                On November 12, 2024, a dodgeball event was held to raise funds for an animal sanctuary donation. The event took place at a local community center, with various teams of participants competing for a good cause. The main objective of the session was to gather donations while encouraging team-building, sportsmanship, and fitness. My role in the activity was to assist the players throughout the event, ensuring they had the necessary equipment and helping coordinate the smooth flow of the matches. Other individuals involved included the event organizers who were responsible for registration, scoring, and safety protocols, as well as volunteers who helped with logistics and crowd control.

                This experience allowed me to learn new skills in event coordination and teamwork. Initially, I expected the event to be more about the competitive aspect of dodgeball, but I was surprised by how much emphasis was placed on the community and charitable aspect. I did not anticipate how much I would enjoy interacting with the players and participants—everyone seemed genuinely excited to be part of the cause. One of the event organizers made a strong impression on me with their leadership and calm demeanor in managing the event. What I liked most was seeing the enthusiasm of the participants, while the most challenging part was ensuring that everything ran on schedule. I was able to express my values of compassion and helping others by supporting the event’s mission to raise money for the animal sanctuary.
                
                This experience definitely impacted my worldview by showing me the power of sports and community events in bringing people together for a cause. I’ve learned how organizing such events can foster not only fun and exercise but also goodwill. Moving forward, I plan to continue my involvement with this group by volunteering at future events to help with coordination and ensure that they are as successful as this one. I see the benefits of participating in activities like this because they create a sense of unity and purpose. If I could do the project again, I would work on preparing even more in advance to avoid any last-minute adjustments, and maybe even introduce more activities to engage the audience further.
                
                Because of this activity, I am more motivated to volunteer and support community initiatives, understanding that every small effort can contribute to a larger, meaningful cause.

                    On September 29, 2024, I was assigned as the logistics head for the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) SA SU cleanup drive, which took place at Silliman Beach. My main responsibility was to oversee the necessary logistics to ensure the event ran smoothly. Along with my friend Akir, I was in charge of managing the documents and paperwork that needed to be signed for the event to take place. Our goal was to prepare all the required permissions and formalities to secure approval and ensure the success of the cleanup drive. Other team members were responsible for tasks like coordinating the volunteers, setting up the venue, and managing supplies. Together, we aimed to make the event organized and efficient, ultimately contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable community.

                    This activity allowed me to develop valuable organizational and teamwork skills. Initially, I expected the role to be mostly about handling documents and ensuring all signatures were obtained. However, I was surprised by how much coordination was needed with different departments and stakeholders to make sure everything was in place. I also enjoyed working closely with Akir, as we had to communicate effectively to keep everything on track. The person who made a strong impression on me was one of the team leaders who helped streamline the paperwork process, making it much easier than anticipated. What I liked most about the experience was how everyone was dedicated to the cause, while the most challenging part was dealing with the bureaucratic delays in getting signatures. This experience reflected my values of responsibility and commitment to community improvement.

                    The experience had a significant impact on my worldview, particularly in how important logistics and organization are to the success of community-driven projects. It highlighted that even seemingly small tasks, like paperwork, play a vital role in making a bigger event possible. Through this, I’ve learned how the behind-the-scenes efforts contribute to the overall success of community events, and I plan to apply this knowledge in future volunteer roles. I also intend to continue my involvement with the DOST SA SU group and assist in future events. I see the benefits of this activity because it helps improve the environment and fosters a sense of teamwork. If I could do the project again, I would work on starting the documentation process earlier to avoid delays and streamline the approval process.

                    Because of this activity, I am more aware of the significance of logistical planning and the impact that each detail, no matter how small, has on the success of a larger community effort.

                    On November 12, 2024, June Pinero, the event organizer, held a feeding program at Sibulan Elementary School. The event was aimed at providing meals to the children in the school, ensuring that they had access to nutritious food. I was assigned as a sub-organizer for the event, assisting with the overall coordination and logistics. My tasks included helping set up the venue, managing the distribution of food, and making sure that everything was in place for the smooth running of the program. The event was supported by volunteers who helped with serving meals, interacting with the children, and cleaning up afterward, all working together to create a positive experience for the students.

                    This experience allowed me to develop skills in event coordination, particularly in managing food distribution and overseeing volunteers. Initially, I expected the role to be focused on simply assisting the main organizer, but I was surprised by how much responsibility I had in helping manage the flow of the event. I also learned the importance of communication, as I had to ensure that all volunteers knew their tasks and that the food was served in an orderly manner. One of the volunteers, who was very efficient and proactive in helping with the food setup, made a strong impression on me with their dedication to the cause. The most satisfying part of the event was seeing the joy on the children's faces as they received their meals. What I found challenging was ensuring that the food was served on time, as there were unexpected delays in the kitchen. This event reflected my values of compassion and the importance of giving back to the community.
                    
                    The experience impacted my worldview by showing me how small acts of kindness, like providing a meal to those in need, can have a big impact on a community. It made me realize the importance of organizing such events to support children and families who may not have access to proper nutrition. Through this, I learned how collaboration and careful planning are crucial to the success of charitable programs. Moving forward, I plan to continue supporting similar initiatives and contribute to organizing future feeding programs. I see the benefits of this activity as it not only helps the children but also brings the community together for a shared cause. If I could do the project again, I would work on improving the timing and logistics to ensure smoother food distribution.
                    
                    Because of this activity, I am more inspired to organize and volunteer for community service projects, knowing that even small efforts can make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.
