                On August 15, 2024, all freshmen participated in the Freshie Walk event, which I believe was organized to officially welcome the new students to Silliman University. The event was designed to introduce us to the campus, allow us to meet other freshmen, and create a sense of belonging within the university community. After the convocation, there was a sweet treat waiting for us—free ice cream, which made the event even more enjoyable. I was excited to be part of this activity, as it offered a chance to interact with my fellow freshmen and explore the campus.

                This experience allowed me to connect with other students in a relaxed, fun environment. Initially, I thought it would be just a simple walk around the campus, but I was surprised by how welcoming and lively the event was. The convocation helped set the tone for the day, and the ice cream afterward provided a nice break and a sweet way to end the activity. The most enjoyable part of the event was the opportunity to meet new people and to feel part of something bigger, especially with everyone sharing the excitement of starting university life together. What surprised me the most was how quickly everyone bonded, despite being strangers just hours earlier. This event reflected my values of inclusivity and community, as it brought together people from different backgrounds to celebrate the beginning of a new chapter in our lives.

                The Freshie Walk had a significant impact on my perspective by showing me how important such welcoming activities are in making newcomers feel accepted and part of a community. It highlighted the importance of creating traditions that help foster connections and provide a sense of belonging. From this experience, I learned how simple yet thoughtful gestures, like offering free ice cream, can leave a lasting positive impression. Going forward, I plan to continue participating in similar activities and encourage other freshmen to do the same, as it helps build strong, supportive friendships. I see the benefits of this event because it helped me feel more comfortable in my new environment. If I could do the project again, I would encourage even more interactive activities to further engage everyone.

                Because of this activity, I am more excited about being part of the Silliman University community and look forward to more opportunities to meet new people and engage in campus life.

                    On August 16, 2024, there was a departmental tour event for all the colleges at Silliman University, and fortunately, the schedule for the College of Computer Studies (CSS) was also on that day. My classmates and I were able to attend the tour despite having a class earlier in the day. The tour took us around various parts of the university, including different college departments and their facilities. It was an excellent opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the campus, the departments, and the resources available to students, especially for those who, like me, were new to the university.

                    This experience gave me a better understanding of the Silliman campus and all it has to offer. Initially, I expected the tour to be a basic introduction to the main buildings and resources, but I was pleasantly surprised by the detailed information shared by our tour guide, who showed us the facilities that are specific to our department. I particularly enjoyed learning about the various computer labs, libraries, and study areas available to CSS students. What impressed me the most was seeing the dedication to providing advanced resources and creating an environment conducive to learning. The most enjoyable part of the tour was discovering places I hadn't known about before, and it felt reassuring to see the efforts the university puts into providing its students with the tools they need for success.

                    The tour impacted my view of the university by giving me a greater sense of pride in being part of such a well-equipped and supportive institution. I now have a clearer picture of the available spaces and resources I can utilize to excel in my studies. The experience also helped me realize how important it is to take part in these events to make the most of university life. Going forward, I plan to explore other parts of the campus and attend more events that can help me better understand the different opportunities Silliman University offers. I see the benefits of this activity in terms of familiarizing students with their surroundings and making them feel more at home in their academic environment. If I could do the project again, I would suggest including even more interactive discussions about each department’s specific offerings and opportunities for students.

                    Because of this activity, I am more excited and prepared to fully engage in my studies and make the most of the resources available at Silliman University.

                    On August 19, 2024, Silliman University held an<br/> acquaintance party for the students, which was a<br/> highly anticipated event. The night was filled with<br/> fun activities, including various booths, concerts,<br/> and food stalls. The vibrant atmosphere created a<br/> sense of excitement, as it allowed students to<br/> meet new people and enjoy the entertainment.<br/> The event was a great way to unwind, interact<br/> with fellow students, and celebrate the beginning<br/> of the school year. I found myself enjoying the lively<br/> performances and the wide variety of food available,<br/> which always seemed to catch my eye.

                    This event<br/> provided me with an opportunity to meet many students<br/> from different backgrounds, and I learned the importance<br/> of socializing in such a setting. Initially, I expected the<br/> event to be fun, but I was surprised by the energy<br/> and enthusiasm that filled the space, especially<br/> as I interacted with classmates I had never spoken<br/> to before. The food stalls were particularly memorable,<br/> as the delicious aromas and variety of options made<br/> it hard to resist trying everything. What stood out to<br/> me the most was how welcoming the environment felt,<br/> with everyone eager to connect and have a good time.<br/> The most satisfying part of the evening was<br/> discovering new food favorites and enjoying the<br/> live music, while the most challenging aspect was<br/> navigating the large crowd. The experience reinforced<br/> my values of community and friendship, as I felt a<br/> deeper connection with my fellow students.

                    The<br/> acquaintance party had a positive impact on my<br/> perspective by showing me how such events can<br/> create a sense of unity and belonging within a university.<br/> It emphasized the value of creating opportunities for<br/> students to engage socially, which helps foster a<br/> supportive campus environment. I learned that<br/> participating in these types of events not only helps<br/> in making new friends but also makes the college<br/> experience more memorable and enjoyable.<br/> Moving forward, I plan to attend similar events<br/> and encourage others to do the same, as they<br/> contribute to a vibrant, inclusive campus life. I see<br/> the benefits of this activity in how it brings students<br/> together, regardless of their backgrounds, and <br/>creates lasting connections.

                    Because of this<br/> activity, I am more excited about the opportunities<br/> to connect with others and engage in campus life,<br/> knowing that events like these play a big part in building<br/> a strong university community.

                    On August 21, 2024, I watched the Tone Key Quartet<br/> perform at the Luce Auditorium, as it was a required<br/> activity for our music class. The concert featured a<br/> variety of performances, and I was particularly excited<br/> to experience the live music in such a great venue.<br/> The quartet’s performance was impressive, showcasing<br/> different instruments and musical styles. As I watched,<br/> I found myself particularly drawn to the male drummer,<br/> Satoshi Mitsumoto. Not only did he play the drums,<br/> but he also played several other instruments, which I<br/> found absolutely fascinating. His versatility and energy<br/> throughout the performance amazed me, making the<br/> experience even more enjoyable.

                    This event allowed<br/> me to gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity<br/> and beauty of live music. Initially, I expected the<br/> performance to be just a typical concert, but I was<br/> surprised by how much more engaging it was with<br/> Satoshi’s ability to switch between different instruments<br/> seamlessly. His skill and enthusiasm added a layer<br/> of excitement to the entire performance. What impressed<br/> me the most was seeing how musicians can master multiple<br/> instruments and bring a unique flair to their performances.<br/> The most enjoyable part was watching the interaction<br/> between the musicians, especially Satoshi, whose<br/> energy and talent were captivating. The most<br/> challenging part of the experience, however, was<br/> following the technical aspects of the performance,<br/> as there were moments where I couldn’t quite catch<br/> the intricate details of the music. This experience<br/> highlighted my value for creativity and the importance<br/> of embracing different forms of expression through<br/> music.
                    
                    The performance at Luce Auditorium had a<br/> significant impact on my perspective by showing me<br/> how diverse and versatile music can be. It deepened<br/> my understanding of the various instruments and their<br/> roles in a musical ensemble. From this, I learned the<br/> importance of being open to different musical styles<br/> and the skills required to play multiple instruments. I<br/> plan to continue exploring music and perhaps learn<br/> more about the different instruments that musicians<br/> play. I see the benefits of this activity in how it<br/> enhances our cultural experience and exposes us to<br/> the rich world of live performances. If I could attend<br/> the event again, I would love to focus more on the<br/> different instruments and the techniques used by the<br/> musicians to create such an impactful performance.<br/>
                    
                    Because of this activity, I am more inspired to learn<br/> about different musical instruments and to appreciate<br/> the skill and creativity involved in live music performances.

                    On August 26, 2024, Silliman University held its annual Parada Sillimaniana, where all the departments showcase their dancing and creative skills. Each department represented their unique identity through vibrant performances, and I had the honor of participating as a lead dance performer. The parade took us through the streets of Dumaguete City, leading to the Cimafranca Ballfield, where the celebrations continued. It was an exciting and energetic event, as we walked and danced through the city, celebrating the university's spirit and unity.

                    Being the lead dance performer gave me a unique perspective on the event. I had to ensure that my movements were in sync with the rest of the group, while also maintaining the energy and enthusiasm throughout the parade. Initially, I was nervous about leading the performance, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was to connect with my teammates and the audience through our dance. The most enjoyable part of the experience was seeing the crowd’s excitement and feeling the strong sense of school pride as we performed. What surprised me the most was how well our department worked together to create such a coordinated and dynamic performance. The most challenging part was staying focused and energized during the long walk and making sure the performance stayed sharp from start to finish. This experience reflected my values of leadership, teamwork, and creativity.
                    
                    Parada Sillimaniana had a lasting impact on my perspective by showing me how collaboration and leadership can come together to create something powerful. I realized that leading a performance requires not only skill and precision but also the ability to inspire and energize others. I plan to continue participating in such events and strive to improve my leadership and performance skills. I see the benefits of this activity in how it brings the university community together, while also offering opportunities for personal growth and expression. If I could do the event again, I would focus on refining our choreography and ensuring even better coordination between performers.
                    
                    Because of this activity, I am more confident in my abilities as a performer and a leader, and I’m excited to participate in future events that help strengthen the sense of community and school spirit at Silliman University.
